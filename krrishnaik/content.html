        <p>
            Valorant is a tactical, team-based game with a focus on strategy, communication, and gunplay. It features 5v5 matches in which two teams compete against each other in rounds. One team plays the role of the Attackers, while the other plays as the Defenders. The primary game mode is a plant/defuse-style match, where the Attacking teamâ€™s goal is to plant the spike (a bomb-like object) at a designated bomb site and detonate it, while the Defending team tries to prevent them by either eliminating the attacking players or defusing the spike.
            The game is structured around a series of rounds (usually 13 rounds), with players buying weapons and abilities at the start of each round using in-game currency earned from previous rounds.
            A defining feature of Valorant is its Agent system. Each player selects an Agent with unique abilities that add a layer of strategic depth to the game. These abilities can range from offensive attacks, healing, crowd control, or recon (scouting).<br>
        <br>
        There are currently four types of agents:<br><br>

        <b>Duelists</b>: Focused on offense, typically capable of initiating fights. Examples: Jett, Phoenix, Reyna.<br>
        <b>Controllers</b>: Agents who control areas of the map with smoke, blocking vision and controlling space. Examples: Omen, Brimstone, Astra.<br>
        <b>Sentinals</b>: Defensive specialists who provide healing, utility, or protective tools for the team. Examples: Sage, Killjoy.<br>
        <b>Initiators</b>: These agents help their team by initiating attacks or breaking through enemy defenses. Examples: Breach, Sova, Skye.<br>

            Jett is one of Valorant's most agile and dynamic agents, known for her speed, mobility, and ability to quickly take control of a fight. As a Duelist, Jett excels at flanking enemies, creating chaos, and taking high-risk, high-reward plays. Her **Tailwind** allows for swift movement, and her **Updraft** and **Cloudburst** provide her with tools to reposition or block vision. Her **Ultimate, Tailwind**, further boosts her speed, making her a deadly force in both offense and defense. Jett is perfect for players who love fast-paced, aggressive gameplay and can outmaneuver opponents with precision. Her mobility makes her exceptional at escaping danger and taking control of tight situations, making her a top choice for aggressive players.
