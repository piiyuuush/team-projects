hint for unit convertor
    first change the value to standard value
    (example: let's assume 'gram' as standard unit)

    therefore, depending upon the 'from' unit convert it accordingly 
    (if the from unit was kilogram then multiply it by 1000[cuz 1kg = 1000mg])

    now change the value to the 'to' unit by multiplying it w.r.t. gram 
    (example if the to unit was milligram then multiply the value by 1000 [cuz 1 gram = 1000mg] )

    that's the conversion value

    benefit of converting it to the standard value would be that you dont have to make conversion
    for every unit manually like [mg to gram; mg to kilogram; mg to ton;
                                  gram to mg; gram to kilogram; gram to ton; and the list goes on]

    instead we just have to change every unit to gram and gram to every unit

    [common sense though note that to go from gram to mg you'd have to divide gm by 1000]
